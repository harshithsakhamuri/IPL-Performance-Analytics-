# IPL-Performance-Analytics-
📊 IPL Data Analysis & Prediction Project (2008–2022) — Built entirely using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
I created a complete IPL Data Analysis and Prediction System by working across four major Python modules:

✅ Project Breakdown:

🔹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Cleaned and standardized raw IPL ball-by-ball and match-level datasets (2008–2022 seasons)
Handled missing values, corrected team/player/venue names, and ensured dataset consistency
Saved cleaned datasets (cleaned_ball_by_ball.csv, cleaned_match_level.csv) for further analysis

🔹 Player Performance Dashboard
Built a dynamic player analysis system to analyze batting, bowling, fielding, and P.O.M awards over seasons
Visualized player statistics over time using bar charts, line graphs, and over-by-over batting analysis
Generated player-specific over-wise scoring trends and phase-wise (Powerplay, Middle Overs, Death Overs) metrics


🔹 Toss and Decision Impact Analysis
Conducted statistical analysis on toss decisions (batting or bowling first) and match outcomes
Visualized toss vs. match result correlation using bar charts and heatmaps
Performed chi-square test to find the strength of association between toss decision and match result

📈 Key Visualizations Created:
Player over-by-over performance bar graphs
Batting strike rate and economy rate trends
Pie chart of predicted winning probabilities
Toss decision impact stacked bar charts and heatmaps
